## Arduino Nano Glider Controller
Autonomous Glider Controller for a RC Glider. The [autonomous_glider_controller_0.1](autonomous_glider_controller_0.1) folder contains the main sketch code to be uploaded to the Arduino Nano.

### FINISHED:
#### IMU Measurements:
- Accelerometer
- Gyroscope    (Offsets needs to be determined)
- Magnetometer (Needs to be calibrated)
- Pressure sensor for altitude calculation

#### Airspeed Sensor Measurements

#### GPS Data:
- Lattitude and Longitude
- h, m, s
- Groundspeed
- Number of satellites connected

#### Save all measurements to SD Card
- OH SHIT SWITCH saves measurements


### TODO:

Controller Simulation

PCB Design, Print and Solder

Receiver PWM output measure and edit main code

Real time Rudder and Elevator PWM Measurements 

Lateral and Longitudinal Controller 

Navigational Controller
